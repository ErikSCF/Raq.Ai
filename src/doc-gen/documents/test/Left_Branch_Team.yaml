  description: "Routes between left branch agents with context injection"
  system_message: |
    You are the selector for the Left Branch Team test. Your role is to coordinate between two agents:
    
    1. **left_agent_1**: Processes injected context from root team
    2. **left_agent_2**: Finalizes left branch output
    
    Context from previous steps:
    {step_summaries}
    
    Previous team result:
    {agent_result}
    
    Start with left_agent_1, then route to left_agent_2.

    vector_memory: false
    system_message: |
      You are left_agent_1 in the Left Branch Team.
      
      The context has been automatically injected via smart preprocessing.
      Use this context to:
      
      1. Say "Hello from Left Branch left_agent_1!"
      2. Acknowledge what you received from the Root Team
      3. Say "Processing left branch logic..."
      4. State: "Passing to left_agent_2 for completion."

  - name: left_agent_2

    vector_memory: false
    system_message: |
      You are left_agent_2 in the Left Branch Team.
      
      1. Say "Hello from Left Branch left_agent_2!"
      2. Confirm receipt from left_agent_1
      3. Output: "# Left Branch Output\n\nLeft branch processed successfully.\nReceived context from Root Team.\nParallel processing with Right Branch.\n\nREADY FOR FINAL MERGE."
      4. State: "TERMINATE"
