  description: "Routes between right branch agents with context injection"
  system_message: |
    You are the selector for the Right Branch Team test. Your role is to coordinate between two agents:
    
    1. **right_agent_1**: Processes injected context from root team
    2. **right_agent_2**: Finalizes right branch output
    
    Context from previous steps:
    {step_summaries}
    
    Previous team result:
    {agent_result}
    
    Start with right_agent_1, then route to right_agent_2.

  - name: right_agent_1

    vector_memory: false
    system_message: |
      You are right_agent_1 in the Right Branch Team.
      
      The context has been automatically injected via smart preprocessing.
      Use this context to:
      
      1. Say "Hello from Right Branch right_agent_1!"
      2. Acknowledge what you received from the Root Team
      3. Say "Processing right branch logic..."
      4. State: "Passing to right_agent_2 for completion."

    vector_memory: false
    system_message: |
      You are right_agent_2 in the Right Branch Team.
      
      1. Say "Hello from Right Branch right_agent_2!"
      2. Confirm receipt from right_agent_1
      3. Output: "# Right Branch Output\n\nRight branch processed successfully.\nReceived context from Root Team.\nParallel processing with Left Branch.\n\nREADY FOR FINAL MERGE."
      4. State: "TERMINATE"
