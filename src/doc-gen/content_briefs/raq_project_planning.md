# RAQ Project Planning Artifact - Content Brief

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE
This content brief is designed to guide the creation of RAQ (Requirements and Questions) documents - structured project planning artifacts that bridge the gap between initial client conversations and formal Statements of Work (SOW). Based on the proven RAQ framework used for projects like the Lilham Caretaker app.

## TARGET AUDIENCE
- **Primary:** Project managers, solution architects, and technical leads conducting client discovery
- **Secondary:** Sales teams needing structured intake tools, delivery teams translating requirements to SOW
- **Pain Points:** Unstructured client conversations, scope creep, missing technical requirements, unclear effort estimation

## BRAND VOICE & TONE
- **Professional yet approachable** - Technical precision without intimidating non-technical stakeholders
- **Structured and methodical** - Clear frameworks that guide systematic discovery
- **Risk-aware** - Proactively identify assumptions and potential scope expansion areas
- **Collaborative** - Foster alignment between business goals and technical implementation

## CONTENT STRATEGY
Create comprehensive RAQ templates and guidance that standardize project discovery while remaining flexible enough for diverse project types.

## OUTLINE REQUIREMENTS

The RAQ document structure must follow this proven format:

### 1. Project Header & Context
*Include project name, date, author, and estimated reading time for quick reference*

### 2. Client/Project Level Standards & KPIs
*Define foundational requirements that shape the entire project architecture and delivery standards*

### 3. Epic-Based Requirements Matrix
*Organize functionality using the proven Epic → Questions → Decisions → Effort Scoring format*

### 4. High Level Questions Section
*Capture strategic questions that require client clarification before SOW finalization*

### 5. High Level Assumptions Section  
*Document critical assumptions that limit scope and protect against scope creep*

### 6. Notes Section
*Include brainstorming items, future considerations, and complexity flags*

### 7. High Level Summary
*Provide executive overview of core functionality areas*

## FULL ARTICLE GUIDELINES

### RAQ Structure Deep Dive

#### Project Standards Format
Include specific examples like:
- Test coverage requirements (e.g., "20% test coverage for new code")
- Uptime requirements (e.g., "Four 9's uptime")
- Compliance frameworks (HIPAA, COPPA, GDPR)
- Technology stack constraints (e.g., "Use of Mulesoft or other tooling")
- Corporate architecture future state considerations

#### Epic Requirements Matrix
Each epic should include:
- **Epic Name**: Clear functional category (e.g., "User Authentication & Profiles")
- **Guiding Questions**: Discovery questions that uncover technical and business requirements
- **Decisions/Answers**: Client responses and agreed-upon approach
- **Effort Score**: Two-number scoring system (complexity/value - e.g., "7/9")

#### Effort Scoring Framework
Explain the dual scoring methodology:
- **First Number**: Technical complexity/effort (1-10 scale)
- **Second Number**: Business value/impact (1-10 scale)
- **Usage**: Helps prioritize features and estimate resource allocation

#### High Level Questions Best Practices
Focus on strategic uncertainties like:
- CMS requirements and content management approach
- Multi-user access patterns and permissions
- In-app purchase and monetization strategy
- Platform-specific considerations (web vs. mobile)

#### Assumptions Documentation
Structure assumptions to protect scope:
- Technology stack assumptions (e.g., "Assume React Native")
- Feature scope limitations (e.g., "Basic photo/video functionality")
- Integration assumptions (e.g., "Help Center via HubSpot")
- Compliance boundaries (e.g., "TOS excludes messaging from HIPAA")

### Writing Style
- Use structured tables for epic requirements matrix
- Include specific client quotes and responses where applicable
- Provide decision rationale for each epic conclusion
- Balance thoroughness with meeting-friendly scanning format

### Technical Coverage Areas
Address these common epic categories:
- **User Management**: Authentication, roles, permissions, onboarding
- **Communication**: Messaging, video, notifications, offline handling
- **Content Management**: File storage, sharing, search, favorites
- **Scheduling**: Calendar integration, recurring events, conflict resolution
- **Compliance**: Security, privacy, regulatory requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Performance, scalability, monitoring
- **Business Logic**: Workflows, automation, integrations
- **Monetization**: Subscriptions, payments, referrals

### Template Components
The article should provide:
1. **RAQ Header Template** with project metadata format
2. **Standards Checklist** covering common architectural requirements
3. **Epic Template** with question frameworks for major functional areas
4. **Scoring Guidelines** with complexity vs. value assessment criteria
5. **Assumptions Template** with scope protection language
6. **SOW Mapping Guide** showing RAQ → deliverable translation

## REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
Include practical examples from the Lilham Caretaker RAQ:
- **Epic Example**: "Role permissions, invitation method, role immutability, onboarding" with full question-decision-scoring cycle
- **Assumptions Example**: "Assume photo/video functionality is super basic" with scope protection rationale
- **Standards Example**: HIPAA compliance boundaries with TOS exclusions
- **Scoring Example**: Messaging features scored as "8/10" with complexity/value justification

## KEY MESSAGING
- RAQs prevent costly scope creep by capturing requirements upfront in structured format
- Epic-based organization maps directly to SOW deliverables and resource planning
- Dual scoring system enables data-driven prioritization decisions
- Clear assumptions create legal and scope protection for delivery teams
- Structured format improves client communication and expectation management

## SUCCESS METRICS
Readers should be able to:
1. Create comprehensive RAQ documents using the proven epic-matrix format
2. Conduct effective discovery sessions with structured questioning frameworks
3. Apply dual scoring methodology for effort vs. value assessment
4. Document protective assumptions that prevent scope creep
5. Translate RAQ outputs directly into SOW sections and resource estimates
6. Handle complex scenarios like compliance boundaries and multi-user permissions

## CONTENT LENGTH TARGET
Comprehensive guide: 3,000-4,000 words with complete templates, real examples, and step-by-step implementation guidance.
